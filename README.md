### What I learned

This challenge was good for helping to understand the basic process of deploying into a production site.  In addition I found it useful to brush up on CSS Grid.  Although centering the component could be done in a number of ways I wanted to focus on using Grid.

I also brushed up on the use of static assets using NextJs.  In reality I did not need an applicaiton framework or React.  But I wanted to get more aquainted the environment for future work.


### Continued development

I will continue using NextJs and sometimes making it more simple for simple tasks.
